            <p class="col-md-12">Dungeon Siege is set in the Kingdom of Ehb, a varied region on the continent of
                Aranna containing deserts, swamps, forests, and mountains, created three centuries earlier at
                the dissolution of the Empire of Stars. At the beginning of the game, the player character's
                farming village is attacked by a race of creatures named the Krug. The main character, a farmer
                with no given background who is named by the player, journeys through the Krug forces to the
                town of Stonebridge. Upon breaking the siege of the town, and gaining their first companion, the
                player character is tasked by the town's garrison leader Gyorn with journeying to the town of
                Glacern and alerting the Ehb military forces, called the 10th Legion, of the incursion and
                defeating any forces they encounter along the way. After journeying through crypts, mines, and
                mountains, the player character reaches Glacern, where they are informed that the Krug invasion
                happened the same day that the Grand Mage Merik disappeared, and are charged with traveling over
                the mountains to Fortress Kroth to assist the legion there. In the mountains they find Merik,
                who informs them that the Krug invasion is part of a larger invasion by the Seck, who destroyed
                the Empire of Stars before being imprisoned underneath Castle Ehb, and who have escaped and
                taken the castle. Merik asks the player to help recover the Staff of Stars from the Goblins.
                Prior to its theft, the Staff had kept the Seck imprisoned in the Vault of Eternity.</p>

            <p class="col-md-12">The player fights through monsters and bandits in crystal caves, a forest, a
                swamp, and an underground Goblin fortress filled with mechanical war machines. After recovering
                the Staff from the Goblins, the player character meets a division of the 10th Legion and is
                pointed towards Fortress Kroth, which has been overrun with undead. After clearing the fortress
                and fighting monsters and a dragon in the Cliffs of Fire, they march on Castle Ehb. The player
                characters then storm the castle and fight through the Seck forces to rescue King Konreid. He
                informs the party that the Seck's leader, Gom, is seeking the magical weapons from the Empire of
                Stars stored in the Chamber of Stars, and that the characters must secure the weapons and then
                defeat the remaining Seck. The player character collects the weapons and fights through lava
                caves and the Vault of Eternity where the Seck had been imprisoned. The player character kills
                Gom, defeating the Seck and saving the kingdom.</p>
