                    <p class="col-md-12">After it was showcased at E3 2000, Dungeon Siege proceeded to win the Best
                        RPG award from Game Revolution and Most Immersive Role-playing Game award from GameSpot.
                        After release, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) nominated Dungeon Siege for
                        "Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year" and "Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming" at
                        the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; it did not win either category, losing to
                        Neverwinter Nights and Battlefield 1942, respectively. The game was also a nominee for PC
                        Gamer US's "2002 Best Roleplaying Game" award, but lost again to Neverwinter Nights. It did
                        win the Best PC Game Graphics award from IGN.</p>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Gas Powered Games' release of the Siege Editor did spark the rise of a
                        modding community around the game; even before release several modding groups announced
                        intentions to use the engine to create large-scale mods remaking games from the Ultima
                        series of role playing games. After the game's release, numerous mods were created,
                        including several "total conversion" mods that made wholly new games and stories such as
                        "The Lands of Hyperborea" and "Elemental". Gas Powered Games released one mod of their own
                        in July 2002 titled "Yesterhaven", created by six designers over six weeks, which provided a
                        short multiplayer storyline for low-level characters wherein they defended a town from three
                        thematic plagues of monsters. It was followed up by Legends of Aranna, a full expansion pack
                        developed by Mad Doc Software and released on November 11, 2003 for Windows and Mac OS X by
                        Microsoft. The expansion pack added little new gameplay besides new terrains, creatures, and
                        items, but featured an entirely separate story from the original game. In Legends, the
                        player controls another unnamed farmer; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by a creature
                        called the Shadowjumper, they set off to retrieve it. After fighting their way through
                        monsters in icy hills, jungles, and islands, the player arrives at the mystical Great Clock,
                        a giant artifact which controls Aranna's seasons. There they defeat the Shadowjumper and
                        retrieve the Staff of Stars. It received generally less positive reviews than the original,
                        with critics praising the amount of content but criticizing the lack of changes to the base
                        gameplay. At the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the AIAS nominated Legends of
                        Aranna for "Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year", though it lost to Star Wars: Knights of
                        the Old Republic.</p>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Several other games have been released in the Dungeon Siege series,
                        beginning with Dungeon Siege II (2005). That game received its own expansion pack, Dungeon
                        Siege II: Broken World (2006), and was followed by a spinoff PlayStation Portable game
                        titled Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony (2006) and a third main title, Dungeon Siege III
                        (2011). A movie directed by Uwe Boll and inspired by the original game, In the Name of the
                        King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, was released in theaters in 2007; it has been described as being
                        "loosely based" on the game, and was a commercial and critical failure. It was followed by
                        the home video sequels In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds (2011) and In the Name of the
                        King 3: The Last Mission (2014).</p>
