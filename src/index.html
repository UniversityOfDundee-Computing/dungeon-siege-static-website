                    <p class="col-md-12">Dungeon Siege was commercially successful, selling over 1.7 million copies.
                        According to the NPD Group, preorders of the game in the month before its release made it the
                        eighth-best selling computer game of March 2002, and upon release in the following month it rose
                        to second-best selling, after The Sims: Vacation. It fell to seventh and then thirteenth place
                        the following two months, and finished in 14th place for the year overall. By August 2006, it
                        had sold 360,000 copies and earned $14.5 million in the United States alone. This led Edge to
                        declare it the country's 44th-best selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006.
                        By September 2002, Dungeon Siege had also received a "Gold" certification from the Verband der
                        Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across
                        Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
                    <p class="col-md-12">The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review
                        aggregator Metacritic as the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002, behind
                        Neverwinter Nights and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and the twenty-first-highest computer
                        game overall for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Dan Adams of IGN called it
                        "ridiculously pretty to watch", while reviewers for GameSpot and GamePro praised the
                        environments as being detailed and varied. Robert Coffey of Computer Gaming World and Greg
                        Vederman of PC Gamer similarly lauded the detailed environments, while Andy McNamara and
                        Kristian Brogger of Game Informer and GameSpy's Peter Suciu called out the seamless world
                        without loading screens as especially worthy of note. Suciu further praised how the freeform,
                        seamless map was used to create areas that were not shaped like rectangular regions with a
                        winding path filling up the space, as was typical with other role-playing games of the time. The
                        IGN and GamePro reviewers commended the sound effects as excellent and for helping to create the
                        atmosphere of the game, while the IGN and GameSpot reviewers also praised the "ambient
                        orchestral score".</p>
                    <p class="col-md-12">The gameplay was similarly lauded; the GamePro review claimed that "Dungeon
                        Siege's gameplay is perhaps its biggest and most transparent improvement over previous titles in
                        the genre." Several reviewers compared it favorably to Diablo II (2000), then one of the most
                        popular computer action role-playing games, with Adams of IGN claiming that it was very similar
                        to Diablo II with some changes and improvements, and Coffey of Computer Gaming World stating
                        that the only thing keeping it from being directly rated as better was that the shift to a more
                        tactical gameplay made it too different of a game to directly compare. PC Gamer's Vederman,
                        Computer Gaming World's Coffey, and the GameSpot reviewer praised the gameplay as being
                        streamlined and accessible; they liked the tactical nature of controlling a party of adventurers
                        who improved according to how they were used rather than directly controlling their actions and
                        statistics. IGN's Adams, however, said that the gameplay could get monotonous, Vederman of PC
                        Gamer felt that the gameplay combat choices were somewhat limited, and GameSpy's Suciu disliked
                        the linearity of the single-player game. Adams further added that many of the tactical choices
                        in the game were inconsequential, as all battles quickly devolved into brawls, and that the
                        freeform system of leveling was essentially the same as four character classes as pursuing
                        multiple tracks was ineffective.</p>
                    <p class="col-md-12">The multiplayer content received mixed reviews: Adams praised the amount of
                        additional content, while Suciu and the GameSpot reviewer noted that the multiplayer gameplay
                        could easily become unbalanced between different players. The single-player plot was generally
                        dismissed as inconsequential: the GamePro reviewer termed it "skeletal" and the Game Informer
                        reviewers "lackluster", and the GameSpot reviewer called it "bland and forgettable" and
                        concluded that players who wanted a "deeper role-playing game" would be disappointed. Overall,
                        Vederman of PC Gamer called Dungeon Siege "one of the best, most enjoyable games of the year"
                        and GamePro's reviewer claimed it "walks all over its competition with almost effortless grace",
                        while Adams of IGN concluded that it was entertaining but had "untapped potential".</p>

                    <p class="col-md-12">After it was showcased at E3 2000, Dungeon Siege proceeded to win the Best
                        RPG award from Game Revolution and Most Immersive Role-playing Game award from GameSpot.
                        After release, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) nominated Dungeon Siege for
                        "Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year" and "Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming" at
                        the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; it did not win either category, losing to
                        Neverwinter Nights and Battlefield 1942, respectively. The game was also a nominee for PC
                        Gamer US's "2002 Best Roleplaying Game" award, but lost again to Neverwinter Nights. It did
                        win the Best PC Game Graphics award from IGN.</p>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Gas Powered Games' release of the Siege Editor did spark the rise of a
                        modding community around the game; even before release several modding groups announced
                        intentions to use the engine to create large-scale mods remaking games from the Ultima
                        series of role playing games. After the game's release, numerous mods were created,
                        including several "total conversion" mods that made wholly new games and stories such as
                        "The Lands of Hyperborea" and "Elemental". Gas Powered Games released one mod of their own
                        in July 2002 titled "Yesterhaven", created by six designers over six weeks, which provided a
                        short multiplayer storyline for low-level characters wherein they defended a town from three
                        thematic plagues of monsters. It was followed up by Legends of Aranna, a full expansion pack
                        developed by Mad Doc Software and released on November 11, 2003 for Windows and Mac OS X by
                        Microsoft. The expansion pack added little new gameplay besides new terrains, creatures, and
                        items, but featured an entirely separate story from the original game. In Legends, the
                        player controls another unnamed farmer; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by a creature
                        called the Shadowjumper, they set off to retrieve it. After fighting their way through
                        monsters in icy hills, jungles, and islands, the player arrives at the mystical Great Clock,
                        a giant artifact which controls Aranna's seasons. There they defeat the Shadowjumper and
                        retrieve the Staff of Stars. It received generally less positive reviews than the original,
                        with critics praising the amount of content but criticizing the lack of changes to the base
                        gameplay. At the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the AIAS nominated Legends of
                        Aranna for "Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year", though it lost to Star Wars: Knights of
                        the Old Republic.</p>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Several other games have been released in the Dungeon Siege series,
                        beginning with Dungeon Siege II (2005). That game received its own expansion pack, Dungeon
                        Siege II: Broken World (2006), and was followed by a spinoff PlayStation Portable game
                        titled Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony (2006) and a third main title, Dungeon Siege III
                        (2011). A movie directed by Uwe Boll and inspired by the original game, In the Name of the
                        King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, was released in theaters in 2007; it has been described as being
                        "loosely based" on the game, and was a commercial and critical failure. It was followed by
                        the home video sequels In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds (2011) and In the Name of the
                        King 3: The Last Mission (2014).</p>
