            <p>Dungeon Siege is an action role-playing game set in a pseudo-medieval high fantasy world,
                presented in 3D with a third-person virtual camera system under the control of the player, in
                which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player
                chooses the gender and customizes the appearance of the main character of the story prior to the
                start of the game and typically controls them. The main character is joined by up to seven other
                characters, which are controlled via artificial intelligence; the player may switch which
                character they are controlling at any time. The other characters move in relation to the
                controlled character according to the formation and level of aggression towards enemies chosen
                by the player. The additional characters can be removed from the group and re-recruited at any
                given time.</p>

            <p>The game world is not broken up into levels, but is instead one large area not separated by
                loading screens. As the player journeys through the largely linear world, they encounter
                numerous monsters and enemies of varying types that attack whenever the party of player
                characters approach. The party defends themselves and attacks enemies using melee and ranged
                weapons, and nature and combat magic. The player does not select a character class for the
                characters, unlike other role-playing video games; instead, using weapons or magic of a
                particular type increases the character's skill with them over time. Whenever a player gains
                enough experience points from killing enemies and reaches a new level in that weapon type, they
                gain some number of points in their strength, dexterity, or intelligence statistics, which in
                turn relate to the number of health points and mana that they have, and damage that they do with
                weapons.</p>

            <p>Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, which provide attack or defense points,
                or give bonuses to some other statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore
                a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies,
                breaking containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented
                as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character
                type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.</p>

            <p>Dungeon Siege has both a single-player and multiplayer mode. The single-player mode consists of a
                single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use
                one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight
                players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which
                features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it.
                Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of
                higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for
                competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via local area
                networks, direct IP addresses, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone
                matchmaking service.</p>
