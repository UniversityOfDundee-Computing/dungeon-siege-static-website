            <p class="col-md-12">Dungeon Siege is an action role-playing game developed by Gas Powered Games and
                published by Microsoft in April 2002, for Microsoft Windows, and the following year by Destineer
                for Mac OS X. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young
                farmer and her companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to
                warn the nearby town of the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the
                companions that join her along the way are soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race
                called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video
                games of the time, the world of Dungeon Siege does not have levels but is a single, continuous
                area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also,
                rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the
                group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their
                character growth.</p>

            <p class="col-md-12">Dungeon Siege was the first title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded in
                May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 real-time strategy game Total Annihilation.
                Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor wanted to create a
                different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action
                role-playing game as their first title. Taylor also served as one of the designers for the game,
                joined by Jacob McMahon as the other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the lead
                story and dialogue writer. The music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total
                Annihilation. Gas Powered Games concentrated on making a role-playing game that was stripped of
                the typical genre elements they found slow or frustrating, to keep the player focused on the
                action. Development took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two;
                completing the game within even four years required the team to work 12- to 14-hour days and
                weekends for most of the time. </p>

            <p class="col-md-12">The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review
                aggregator Metacritic as the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002. Critics
                praised the graphics and seamless world, as well as the fun and accessible gameplay, but were
                dismissive of the plot. Dungeon Siege sold over 1.7 million copies, and was nominated for the
                Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year award by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. Gas
                Powered Games emphasized creating and releasing tools for players to use in making mods for the
                game during development, which resulted in an active modding community after release. An
                expansion pack, Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, was released in 2003, and a further series of
                games was developed in the franchise, consisting of Dungeon Siege II (2005) and its own
                expansion Dungeon Siege II: Broken World (2006), a spinoff PlayStation Portable game titled
                Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony (2006), and a third main title, Dungeon Siege III (2011). A
                trilogy of movies, with the first loosely inspired by the plot of Dungeon Siege, were released
                as In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007, theaters), In the Name of the King 2:
                Two Worlds (2011, home video), and In the Name of the King 3: The Last Mission (2014, home
                video).</p>
