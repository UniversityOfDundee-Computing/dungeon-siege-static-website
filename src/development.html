                    <h3>Founding</h3>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Gas Powered Games was founded in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known
                        for the 1997 real-time strategy game Total Annihilation. Joined by several of his
                        coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor wanted to create a different type of game
                        than before, and after trying several concepts the team decided to make an action
                        role-playing game as their first title. As well as helping create the initial concept,
                        Taylor served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the
                        game's other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the game's lead story and
                        dialogue writer. Hallford was brought onto the project after it had already started;
                        Taylor had devised the start and end of the game but left the intervening details and
                        background story to him. The game's music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also
                        worked on Total Annihilation. The development team included around thirty people during
                        development, with changes over time, and reached forty at the project's conclusion. The
                        development of the game took over four years, though it was initially planned to take
                        only two.</p>

                <li class="timeline-item pb-4">
                    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Dungeon Siege was inspired by prior role-playing games such as Baldur's
                        Gate and the Ultima series, but primarily by Diablo, which Taylor admired for having an
                        experience that "concentrated on action" that players could jump into without first
                        researching the gameplay details and settings. Taylor wanted to expand that concept into
                        a streamlined, immersive, and action-heavy role-playing game that removed common
                        elements of the genre that he found boring, frustrating, or slow. Taylor also wanted to
                        make the gameplay itself simpler than contemporary role-playing games, so as to appeal
                        to a wider audience. To that end, he asked Hallford to craft a narrative that was also
                        fast and streamlined; he had him write a detailed backstory for the game, which would
                        not be presented to players but would inform and inspire the developers, leaving the
                        in-game text restrained to keep players engaged with the action. Hallford described the
                        process of writing for the game as similar to other game projects, besides a greater
                        emphasis on brevity, though he has said that he was brought onto the project much later
                        than he usually is, which meant that he had to create a story that worked as a
                        background to the set pieces that had already been developed. The plot of the game was
                        intended by Taylor to be subordinate to the gameplay; to that end, he was unconcerned
                        that his overall story arc was considered, even by the development team, to be somewhat
                        of a cliché, as he felt that journeying to defeat an "ultimate evil" was very motivating
                        to players. Taylor and Hallford discussed producing a Dungeon Siege novel to explore
                        Hallford's story, though it never came to fruition.</p>

                    <h3>Improve Role-Playing Genre</h3>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Taylor wanted to further improve on the Diablo role-playing game
                        formula by removing the concept of picking a character class at all and omitting
                        Diablo's long loading times. The development team also tried to make the game more
                        streamlined by removing the need to backtrack to previously visited towns to sell items,
                        by adding inventories to companion characters and pack mules. At one point in
                        development, they planned to have a "helper" character who would pick up items dropped
                        by enemies to let the player avoid doing so themselves. The developers also changed some
                        elements that were standard in role-playing games that Taylor and the other developers
                        found frustrating, such as letting players resell items to vendors for the same price
                        that they were bought for instead of a steep discount, and "sipping" or only partially
                        using potions instead of always using up the whole item.</p>

                    <h3>Siege Editor</h3>
                    <p class="col-md-12">Gas Powered Games included their game development tool, called the
                        Siege Editor, as a tool for players to mod the game. Having seen the output of players
                        creating mods for Total Annihilation, Taylor wanted to "take that to the extreme" and
                        provide a full set of tools to foster a community of players enhancing and changing the
                        game after release. He felt that the tools, which could allow players to make new game
                        worlds, characters, and gameplay, would help support a large, long-term community of
                        players around the game. Gas Powered Games hoped that providing what Daily Radar called
                        "one of the most comprehensive level toolsets we've ever seen" would allow players to
                        quickly and easily create small game regions, as well as allow more serious modders the
                        ability to develop entire parallel games using the Dungeon Siege game engine. They also
                        hoped that this modding community would be able to enhance and extend the multiplayer
                        gameplay beyond what they could release. Taylor attributed his enthusiasm for releasing
                        their own development tools for modding to both his enjoyment of seeing mods for Total
                        Annihilation produced years after its release as well as the lack of negative
                        consequences to John Carmack and id Software's historical tendency to release the entire
                        source code to their games. Taylor later estimated that the company spent around twenty
                        percent of their budget on developing the modding tools.</p>

                    <h3>Over Scoping</h3>
                    <p class="col-md-12">After the first year of development, Gas Powered Games found that they
                        were not going to be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was
                        the seamless world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but,
                        according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how
                        many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide
                        range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features
                        supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore
                        maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of
                        eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According
                        to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies
                        mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed
                        one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a
                        result, the team was required to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the
                        development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview,
                        Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless
                        world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game
                        for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of
                        70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.</p>

                    <h3>Publishing</h3>
                    <p class="col-md-12">By 2000, Gas Powered Games had begun to search for a publisher for the
                        game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers were interested in the game, but he was
                        convinced by Ed Fries to partner with the newly established Microsoft PC publishing
                        group. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for
                        the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly
                        consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due to the size
                        of the game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at
                        the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001,
                        before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time
                        tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features.
                        Dungeon Siege was released for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, by Microsoft, and for
                        Mac OS X on May 2, 2003, by Destineer.</p>
