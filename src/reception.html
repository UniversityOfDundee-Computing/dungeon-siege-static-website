            <p class="col-md-12">Dungeon Siege was commercially successful, selling over 1.7 million copies.
                According to the NPD Group, preorders of the game in the month before its release made it the
                eighth-best selling computer game of March 2002, and upon release in the following month it rose
                to second-best selling, after The Sims: Vacation. It fell to seventh and then thirteenth place
                the following two months, and finished in 14th place for the year overall. By August 2006, it
                had sold 360,000 copies and earned $14.5 million in the United States alone. This led Edge to
                declare it the country's 44th-best selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006.
                By September 2002, Dungeon Siege had also received a "Gold" certification from the Verband der
                Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across
                Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
            <p class="col-md-12">The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review
                aggregator Metacritic as the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002, behind
                Neverwinter Nights and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and the twenty-first-highest computer
                game overall for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Dan Adams of IGN called it
                "ridiculously pretty to watch", while reviewers for GameSpot and GamePro praised the
                environments as being detailed and varied. Robert Coffey of Computer Gaming World and Greg
                Vederman of PC Gamer similarly lauded the detailed environments, while Andy McNamara and
                Kristian Brogger of Game Informer and GameSpy's Peter Suciu called out the seamless world
                without loading screens as especially worthy of note. Suciu further praised how the freeform,
                seamless map was used to create areas that were not shaped like rectangular regions with a
                winding path filling up the space, as was typical with other role-playing games of the time. The
                IGN and GamePro reviewers commended the sound effects as excellent and for helping to create the
                atmosphere of the game, while the IGN and GameSpot reviewers also praised the "ambient
                orchestral score".</p>
            <p class="col-md-12">The gameplay was similarly lauded; the GamePro review claimed that "Dungeon
                Siege's gameplay is perhaps its biggest and most transparent improvement over previous titles in
                the genre." Several reviewers compared it favorably to Diablo II (2000), then one of the most
                popular computer action role-playing games, with Adams of IGN claiming that it was very similar
                to Diablo II with some changes and improvements, and Coffey of Computer Gaming World stating
                that the only thing keeping it from being directly rated as better was that the shift to a more
                tactical gameplay made it too different of a game to directly compare. PC Gamer's Vederman,
                Computer Gaming World's Coffey, and the GameSpot reviewer praised the gameplay as being
                streamlined and accessible; they liked the tactical nature of controlling a party of adventurers
                who improved according to how they were used rather than directly controlling their actions and
                statistics. IGN's Adams, however, said that the gameplay could get monotonous, Vederman of PC
                Gamer felt that the gameplay combat choices were somewhat limited, and GameSpy's Suciu disliked
                the linearity of the single-player game. Adams further added that many of the tactical choices
                in the game were inconsequential, as all battles quickly devolved into brawls, and that the
                freeform system of leveling was essentially the same as four character classes as pursuing
                multiple tracks was ineffective.</p>
            <p class="col-md-12">The multiplayer content received mixed reviews: Adams praised the amount of
                additional content, while Suciu and the GameSpot reviewer noted that the multiplayer gameplay
                could easily become unbalanced between different players. The single-player plot was generally
                dismissed as inconsequential: the GamePro reviewer termed it "skeletal" and the Game Informer
                reviewers "lackluster", and the GameSpot reviewer called it "bland and forgettable" and
                concluded that players who wanted a "deeper role-playing game" would be disappointed. Overall,
                Vederman of PC Gamer called Dungeon Siege "one of the best, most enjoyable games of the year"
                and GamePro's reviewer claimed it "walks all over its competition with almost effortless grace",
                while Adams of IGN concluded that it was entertaining but had "untapped potential".</p>
